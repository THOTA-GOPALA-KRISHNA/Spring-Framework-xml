Q)why Spring frame work coming into picture?
A)
1) Java Developement was Too complex
( Before spring , enterprise Java apps used EJB containers ,which were:
    .Very heavyweight
    .Required complex XML configuration
    .Needed appliclation servers like Weblogic, WebSphere
    .Hard to test and maintain)
    Spring solves all the above problems
2) To Provide Lightweight Development
 Spring introduced:
 .POJOs
 .No need for heavy server
 .Easy and fast development
and so many.....

In single line - Spring came into picture to make java development simple,LEIGHTWEIGHT, FAST and Flexible by IOc and
Dependency Injection(DI)


Q) what is IOC?
A)IOC - Inversion of control, which means it control the bean(Object) life cycle(creating , managing , destroying)

Here you can imagine there is IOC container which stores the all the beans

Q) What is dependency Injection?
A) Dependency injection is pattern or technique where Spring injects(provides) the required objects into a class,
instead of te class creating them itself

(By using @Autowired annotation you can achieve this)


Total we have 2 type based spring framework
1st one is xml based and
2nd one is java based

---------XML BASED------------
IN General we have different types beans scopes, but we will discuss only two
1) single tone (By default single is assigned to bean, it allows creating only single bean and when ClasspathXml is called
automatically object will be created)
2)Prototype(It allows to create multiple beans, and it will created only when call getBean() method.

Setter Injection----------
By using property attribute in bean we can set the value for a particular var by default
By using constructor-arg we call the parametarized constructor by providing the value and by using index/type we can
maintain the order
--> Autowired byName or byType we can inject the objects into class
By using lazy-init it will create the bean only when it requires
